The client and server is under GPL3. And part of the project:
http://catchchallenger.first-world.info/

The license of the datapack is GPL3. But will be totally remaked in cartoon style.

client/tiled/ is extracted version of http://www.mapeditor.org/, https://github.com/bjorn/tiled

===================================================
This game is a MMORPG, Lan game and a single player game. It's mix of pokemon for the RPG part, lineage for the crafting/clan/MMORPG, X3 for the commerce/fabric/industry. With mod possibility, and datapack.

It's a pixel art game. The work is concentrated on the gameplay/performance/security/creativity/accessibility. The income is to paid the developping and the artwork. The game is fully open source (GPL3).

The gameplay have strong team part, but remain interresting in single player. Have clear advantage on 3G/wifi/TOR connexion or into the tiers world.

===================================================
Programming:

Asynchronous protocol with no influence of internet and server latency. Thread isolation for the important or heavy server task. It can be hosted on ADSL connection.
Qt programming to have multi-platform and assembly access. Internal implementation with event. CLI and GUI server, but no epoll server.
SGBD for Qt version: Mysql 5+, SQLite, PostgreSQL 9+. SGBD for epoll version (async to high performance): Mysql 5.5+, PostgreSQL 9+.
The code source is into 3 part: server, client, datapack.
Use C++11, you need compatible compiler with good std::regex support, like llvm/clang 3.5+, gcc 4.9+.
Epoll server use libpg (postgresql).
The gateway need too curl.

====================================================
Compiling

Dep: zlib (can be disable, it's for tiled map editor), zstd, openssl and Qt openssl enabled to have QSslSocket or QtWebSocket, libogg/libopus for the client, Qt5. libssl, libcrypt (openssl).
For the server: db, db driver (mysql, sqlite for game solo, postgresql, depands of you choice)

Assemble it, for the SERVER AND GAME SOLO put the datapack from:
https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
near the application, you nead have then: CatchChallenger-application(.exe), the datapack -> then datapack/informations.xml
See the compiled example for windows, you need follow the same organisation for the other OS.
Under linux I have for the server:
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/catchchallenger-server-gui (application)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/ (datapack)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/informations.xml (datapack informations)
Under linux I have for the single player game:
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/catchchallenger-single-player (application)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/ (datapack)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/informations.xml (datapack informations)

======================================================
Server:
For the server you need an certificate for the SSL connection (can be self signed), near the binary and named server.crt/server.key.

======================================================
Sources:
The sources of the client/server: https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger
The sources of the datapack: https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
The sources of the site: https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-site

======================================================
Hardware
You need CPU with support of unaligned access on 8/16/32Bits for the server at least (plan to support all CPU)
The server is actually 10-20MB of memory (1MB measured by massif) and 2KB by player
