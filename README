The client and server is under GPLv3. And part of the project:
http://catchchallenger.first-world.info/

The license of the datapack is GPLv3. But will be totally remaked in cartoon style.

The extrapart like xz embedded o lz4 have their own license.

===================================================
This game is a MMORPG, Lan game and a single player game. It's mix of Pokemon for the RPG part, lineage for the crafting/clan/MMORPG, X3 for the commerce/fabric/industry. With mod possibility, and datapack.

It's a pixel art game. The work is concentrated on the gameplay/performance/security/creativity/accessibility. The income is to paid the developping and the artwork. The game is fully open source (GPLv3).

The gameplay have strong team part, but remain interresting in single player. Have clear advantage on 3G/WiFi/Tor connexion or into the tiers world.

===================================================
Programming:

Asynchronous protocol with no influence of internet and server latency. Thread isolation for the important or heavy server task. It can be hosted on ADSL connection.
Qt programming to have multi-platform and assembly access. Internal implementation with event. CLI and GUI server, but no epoll server.
SGBD for Qt version: MySQL 5+, SQLite, PostgreSQL 9+. SGBD for epoll version (async to high performance): MySQL 5.5+, PostgreSQL 9+.
The code source is into 3 part: server, client, datapack.
Use C++11, you need compatible compiler, like llvm/clang 3.5+, gcc 4.9+. You also need a standard library with good std::regex support.
Epoll server use libpg (PostgreSQL).
The gateway needs too curl.

====================================================
Compiling

Dep: zlib, xz-utils, openssl and Qt openssl enabled to have QSslSocket, libvlc for the client (with ogg/vorbis and opus support), Qt5. libssl, libcrypt (openssl), liblzma.
For the server: db, db driver (mysql, sqlite for game solo, postgresql, depands of you choice)
Ubuntu 16.04 add to the .pro:
QMAKE_CFLAGS="-std=c++0x"
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x"

For the Gui server:
cd server/
qmake catchchallenger-server-gui.pro
make
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
mv CatchChallenger-datapack/datapack/ datapack/

For the CLI server:
cd server/
qmake catchchallenger-server-cli.pro
make
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
mv CatchChallenger-datapack/datapack/ datapack/

For the Epoll server (linux only):
Ubuntu: apt-get install qt5-qmake liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev
Debian stretch: apt-get install build-essential gcc automake qt5-qmake liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev qttools5-dev qt5-default
cd server/
qmake catchchallenger-server-cli-epoll.pro
make
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
mv CatchChallenger-datapack/datapack/ datapack/

For the game solo:
Debian stretch: apt-get install build-essential gcc automake qt5-qmake liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev qttools5-dev qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qtscript5-dev libvlc-dev
cd client/single-player/
qmake *.pro
make
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
mv CatchChallenger-datapack/datapack/ datapack/

For the game version ultimate:
Debian stretch: apt-get install build-essential gcc automake qt5-qmake liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev qttools5-dev qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qtscript5-dev libvlc-dev
cd client/ultimate/
qmake *.pro
make
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
mkdir -p datapack/
mv CatchChallenger-datapack/datapack/ datapack/internal/

For the MMORPG game:
cd client/single-server/
qmake *.pro
make

Assemble it, for the SERVER AND GAME SOLO put the datapack from:
https://github.com/alphaonex86/CatchChallenger-datapack
near the application, you nead have then: CatchChallenger-application(.exe), the datapack -> then datapack/informations.xml
See the compiled example for windows, you need follow the same organisation for the other OS.
Under linux I have for the server:
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/catchchallenger-server-gui (application)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/ (datapack)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/build-catchchallenger-server-gui-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/informations.xml (datapack informations)
Under linux I have for the single player game:
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/catchchallenger-single-player (application)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/ (datapack)
/home/user/CatchChallenger/client/build-catchchallenger-ultimate-Qt5_5_2-Debug/datapack/informations.xml (datapack informations)

======================================================
Server:
For the server you need an certificate for the TLS connection (can be self signed), near the binary and named server.crt/server.key.
